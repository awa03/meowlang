# Declaring a Variable 

To declare a variable use the keyword `new`. Variables within `meowlang` are declared constant unless they
are explicitly declared otherwise. This is to ensure all that should be `const` will be `const`.

```
new variable_name;
```

If you would like to declare a variable to be mutable use the `mut` keyword. 
Mutability allows for variables to be modified. You can use the keyword in conjunction with `new` 
or simply omit the `new` keyword all together.

```
mut new variable_mut;
mut variable_mut
```
