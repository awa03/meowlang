## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler with C++11 support or later
- Make (optional, for build automation)

### Building

```bash
# Compile your Meow Lang interpreter
g++ -g -O2 main.cpp -o meow_lang

# Run a Meow Lang program
./meow_lang your_program.meow
```

## 📝 Example Code

```
fun add(a, b) {
    result a + b;
}

check true {
    meow "Hello, world!";
}

fur x = 42;
fur y = 3.14;

$ this is a comment $ 
fur x = 42;

$ terminate comments with $ 
$ they also terminate with newline
$ hypotenuse $ fun pythagorean(a $ side1 $, b $ side2 $){
  $ some code $
}

fur one is nah true;
fun two = !true;
fun two = not true;

fur j = 20;

loop x > 50 {
    x = x + 1;
}

```
